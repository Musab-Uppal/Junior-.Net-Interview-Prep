## ⚡ Quick Reference

### The 4 OOP Pillars
| Pillar | One-liner | C# Keyword |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Bind data + protect invariants | `private`, getters/setters |
| **Abstraction** | Program to contracts, not implementations | `interface`, `abstract` |
| **Inheritance** | "Is-a" relationship, reuse base class | `: BaseClass` |
| **Polymorphism** | Same method, different behavior | `virtual`, `override` |

### DI Lifetimes
| Lifetime | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| `AddTransient` | New instance every time it's requested |
| `AddScoped` | One instance per HTTP request |
| `AddSingleton` | One instance for the application lifetime |

### HTTP Methods
| Method | Action | Has Body |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `GET` | Read | ❌ |
| `POST` | Create | ✅ |
| `PUT` | Replace entire resource | ✅ |
| `PATCH` | Partial update | ✅ |
| `DELETE` | Delete | ❌ |

## 🗺️ How to Use This Repo

1. **Start with OOP** — the most common interview topic for any .NET role.
2. **Then Database** — ERP and enterprise apps live and die by their DB layer.
3. **ASP.NET Core + API** — the runtime and contracts of your apps.
4. **Architectures** — shows you understand the bigger picture.
5. **Auth** — JWT/session is always asked.
6. **C# Fundamentals** — quick-fire difference questions.
7. **Behavioural** — don't neglect this; it's half the interview.
